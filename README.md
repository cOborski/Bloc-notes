Encrypted notebook PWA developed with PHP and JavaScript Ajax.

User can save notes locally or sign in to sync all notes between their devices and encrypt content with AES-256-GCM in a database.

User can also use Markdown to create titles, lists, links, images and checkboxes thanks to [Showdownjs](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown).
